      Who We Are
    </h1>
    <p class="centered">
      We are a group of people who share a common interest in mythological monsters and creatures of historical importance. The history
      of mythological creatures are innately tied into many aspects of life, from the history of our names and family heritage - such as 
      the inclusion of gryphons and phoenixes on European family crests - to the presence of them in popular media such as RPGs and 
      movies, and it's only fair that we highlight some of our favorites. We hope that these creatures interest you in some fashion, and may
      even inspire or encourage a reader to look deeper into them.

      Why These Monsters?
    </h1>
    <p class="centered">
      The monsters featured on our home page share a few major things in common. For one, all monsters shown 
      are related back to major mythology. Many of them are European in origin, especially those originating back to the Greeks,
      though some from other major civilizations are also present. These monsters also all have extensive works behind them, allowing interested 
      readers to indulge in a wide range of stories from various cultures both local and foreign, even if their origins are sometimes extensive 
      or obscure. Lastly, these monsters are all ones that are commonly featured in popular media. Dragons and basilisks are commonly fought enemies
      in the TTRPG game <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>, gorgons and phoenixes are nearly omnipresent in Greek legends, and basilisks, leviathans, manticores
      and manticores appear in popular religious texts. The minotaur and thunderbird are creatures who are referenced often in literary devices, 
      while yetis have spread all the way from the Tibetan mountains into American folklore.

      Where Can I Read More?
    </h1>
    <p class="centered">
      A number of sites online have collection of old myths and historical documents. Although we recommend reading the original sources from physical books and 
      their translations, for online sources we recommend reputable libraries like <a href="https://www.gale.com/religion-and-mythology">the Gale Virtual Library</a> and 
      the <a href="https://www.proquest.com/index?parentSessionId=%2FYCvEbTLhgqHc5rXBKvN%2FLKhcWIAyXNG%2BFMfIgClqJw%3D">ProQuest Database</a>.
